- 👋 Hi, I’m @dxng-sg. I am a PhD student at James Cook University, Singapore. I am currently researching in the area of personality and social psychology. 
- 🙇‍♂️ I am grateful that github community exist. So many have made their code freely accessible so that others can learn from them, and so that we can continue to build on each others' work. I am committed in making my own code freely accessible (but please do cite them if you are using them in your research; I need the citation count, really). 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning predictive modeling and applying them in psychology, political science, and social science research. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning meta-analysis, multivariate regression, and structural equation modelling. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that look at personality and its link with social phenomenon like prejudice. 
- 📫 I am reachable at da.ng@my.jcu.edu.au
